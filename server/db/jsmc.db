This harmless salutation is the least-controversial thing that comes out of Louis C.K.’s mouth as he turns rants on everyday subjects (impatient people, his weight, fatherhood) into hilarious, expletive-laden diatribes where nothing is sacred—not even (gasp!) his children. Who else can name-check Ray Charles and Adolf Hitler in the same breath and elicit a chorus of raucous laughter? Louis C.K. says what’s on his mind, even at the risk of offending, but his “I don’t give a f**k” attitude makes his irreverent brand of humor especially endearing and relatable. His self-deprecating style elevates his filmed live show to a form of therapy, where we, too, can get comic relief from some pretty warped subjects. At one point, Louis C.K. asks, “Where do you draw the line?” With him, there is no line.","release_date":"2010-01-26","poster_path":"assets/fI2bi1mUwhniEubz5eJ1ciXHlMm.jpg","backdrop_path":"assets/ekl6EfJ3rk10CQLnQN6JMh4Bqkq.jpg","rated":"N/A","director":"Louis C.K.","writer":"Louis C.K.","actors":"Louis C.K.","metacritic_rating":"N/A","awards":"N/A","short_plot":"In this unique and dynamic live concert experience, Louis C.K.'s exploration of life after 40 destroys politically correct images of modern life with thoughts we have all had...but would rarely admit to.","imdb_rating":"8.6","imdb_id":"tt1421373","tomato_meter":"N/A","tomato_user_rating":"N/A","tomato_image":"N/A","filedata":[{"filename":"Y:\\Movies\\Louis_CK_LiveAtTheComedyStore_1280x720 (1).mp4","codecShort":"mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2","codecLong":"QuickTime / MOV","duration":3930.263597}],"collection":"Movies","_id":"VZEqEpai5KXOMn0D"}

{"title":"The Sunset Limited","media_type":"movie","id":56831,"long_plot":"Based on the play of the same name by Pulitzer Prize Winner Cormac McCarthy, this searing two-character drama mixes humor and pathos while examining the relationship between strangers who are brought together by desperate circumstances. Set in a New York tenement apartment, the story focuses on two very different men - a deeply religious black ex-con who thwarts the suicide attempt of an asocial white college professor who tried to throw himself in front of an oncoming subway train, 'The Sunset Limited.' As the one attempts to connect on a rational, spiritual and emotional level, the other remains steadfast in his hard-earned despair. Locked in a philosophical debate, both passionately defend their personal credos and try to convert the other.","release_date":"2011-02-12","poster_path":"assets/vv5aU4ed63nWPCrXfnxd40Gx7fQ.jpg","backdrop_path":"assets/dSOBvxzexdJJkKgzPFDDYQWhFZm.jpg","rated":"TV-MA","director":"Tommy Lee Jones","writer":"Cormac McCarthy, Cormac McCarthy (play)","actors":"Samuel L.
