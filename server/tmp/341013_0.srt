East and West

do not mistrust each other
because we're armed.

We're armed because
we mistrust each other.

6
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,673
Mr. Gorbachev,

7
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,712
tear down this wall.

16
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,854
* To treat me like you do?

James fucking Gascoigne.

How did you find me?

28
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:04,721
Maybe you're not as good
at this spy shit as you think.

if I got tagged,

it would be by the best.

But you're not the best,
are you, Bakhtin?

00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,235
You're the biggest fucking cunt
in the KGB.

00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,805
myself, Senior Directorate
Officer Eric Gray;

85
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,868
our American guest,
Emmett Kurzfeld

86
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,807
of the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency;

87
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,243
and returning
British Operational Officer

88
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,848
Lorraine Broughton.

89
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,650
Before we begin, sir,
may I formally request

90
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,082
that Mr. Kurzfeld be removed

91
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,916
-from the debriefing.
-Request denied.

92
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,921
What I have to tell you, sir,
is not for the CIA to hear.

93
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,664
Lorraine, you are the subject
of this debriefing,

94
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:44,931
-not its controller.
-I understand that.

95
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,058
KURZFELD:
I was there, in Berlin.

96
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:51,034
And I'm here with the full
executive authority of Langley.

97
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,834
If it'd make you
more comfortable,

98
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,936
I could stand behind the mirror
with everybody else.

99
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,539
But it's a little crowded
back there.

100
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,708
(quietly):
Cocksucker.

101
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,953
What did you say?

102
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,778
I didn't say anything.

103
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,954
I'm sorry. Did you say
something, Lorraine?

104
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,682
Did you hear me say something?

105
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:13,218
-I thought you said something.
-What did she say?

106
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,893
LORRAINE:
What?

107
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:15,992
(Kurzfeld sighs)

108
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,060
Well...

109
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,662
do you want
to play the tape back?

110
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,842
(sighing):
Well, then...

111
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,336
Shall we begin?

112
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,684
Berlin.

113
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,010
What happened?

114
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,648
Yeah.

115
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,283
(chuckles softly)
Berlin.

116
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,687
(inhales deeply)

117
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,890
(long exhale)

118
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,662
Fuck.

119
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:51,861
(thunder rumbling)

120
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,202
GRAY:
Ah. Lorraine.

121
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,203
Sorry to bring you in
on such short notice.

122
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,765
You know C.

123
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,205
-Yes. -We were just
going over your file.

124
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,140
I see your Russian
is excellent.

125
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,876
An expert in escape
and evasion.

126
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,712
Proficient
in intelligence collection

127
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,017
and hand-to-hand combat.

128
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,378
It's an impressive set
of skills.

129
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,987
Knowing the Reds as I do,

130
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,990
she'll need to use
every damn one of them.

131
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,256
I'll get straight to the point.

132
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,132
How well do you know
James Gascoigne?

133
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,930
Enough to say hello.

134
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,302
We worked together

135
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,200
-in Istanbul in '85.
-He's dead.

136
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,935
Gascoigne was killed last night
on a mission in Berlin.

137
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,372
GRAY:
The West German Police

138
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,077
fished his body out
of the Spree this morning.

139
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,150
And the coroner extracted
a 7.62 Tokarev round

140
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,720
from the base of his skull.

141
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,079
Soviets.

142
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,317
Yesterday, Gascoigne met
with a Stasi officer,

143
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,992
code-named Spyglass.

144
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,892
We promised Spyglass immunity

145
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,734
in exchange
for a document on microfilm,

146
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,729
code-named "the list."

147
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,831
Hidden in a Swiss watch,
no less.

148
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:06,133
The list contains every active
clandestine officer,

149
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,836
all their shady deals.

150
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,098
It's an atomic bomb
of information

151
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,937
that could extend the Cold War
for another 40 years.

152
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:17,483
And we believe the man that
killed Gascoigne now has it.

153
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,880
Our sources point
to Yuri Bakhtin,

154
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:24,024
a KGB hatchet man with more
than a dozen confirmed kills.

155
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,821
LORRAINE:
So you want me in Moscow?

156
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,093
No.

157
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,160
Bakhtin never got
on the flight.

158
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,759
So he's still in Berlin,
along with the list.

159
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,357
Everyone's hunting for it.

160
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,825
The Yanks, the Frogs.

161
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,074
Soviets, of course.

162
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,768
GRAY:
And our man, Percival.

163
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,070
Who's Percival?

164
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,401
David Percival.

165
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,995
He's our number one in Berlin.

166
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,337
(slide projector clicks)

167
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,912
He's your point of contact now.

168
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,836
* Fight the power!

169
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:00,946
* Fight the power...

170
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,458
Straight from the tit
of the Virgin Mary.

171
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,230
* We got to fight
the powers that be *

172
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,059
* As the rhythm's
designed to bounce *

173
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,795
* What counts
is that the rhyme's *

174
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,360
* Designed to fill your mind

175
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,228
* Now that you realize
the pride's arrived *

176
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,766
* We got to pump the stuff
to make us tough *

177
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:18,113
* From the heart,
it's a start, a work of art *

178
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,168
* To revolutionize, make a
change, nothing's strange... *

179
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,907
The Jordache wasn't easy.

180
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,512
It's for my wife's birthday.

181
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,953
That's really nice.

182
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,448
Now, where's that fucking list?

183
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,049
I gave the microfilm
to Gascoigne last night.

184
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,552
James didn't show up.

185
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,953
I did my part.

186
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,315
I gave him the list.

187
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,323
You have to get me
and my family across.

188
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,085
It's not safe
for us anymore here.

189
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,094
The Russians are onto me.

190
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,556
No list, no deal.

191
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,963

00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,126
-I risked everything.
-No list, no deal.

193
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,895
You listen to me, Spyglass.

194
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,204
Without that list, why
shouldn't I take you outside

195
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,435
and shoot you
in the fucking head?

196
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,139
You are going to kill
a Stasi officer?

197
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,272
One that's about to defect
to the West? Yeah.

198
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,477
Without an embassy
to look after him,
