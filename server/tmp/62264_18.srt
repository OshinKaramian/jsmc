1
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,372
Do you believe in
the existence of evil?

2
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:07,944
Help me!

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,642
Oh.
No!

4
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:14,683
30 years ago, I found
the Book of the Dead.

5
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:17,052
Now, because I read
from the book...

6
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,621
Missar-drah--

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,390
... evil has found me.

8
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:24,464
You have no idea
what you're doing!

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,429
Of course I know
what I'm doing.

10
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:28,758
I wrote this book.

11
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,396
Ruby is in Elk Grove,
Michigan.

12
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:34,841
That's my hometown.

13
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:36,796
Ash?

14
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,414
Hiya Pop.

15
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,436
I got a problem.

16
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,412
The book--
it did something to me.

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,810
It changed me.

18
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:44,981
Night night.

19
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,148
That's our cue!

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,590
Evil, if you show your ugly mug
in this town ever again,

21
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:59,061
I will take you down
and I will wipe you out!

22
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,598
You know me
as Ash Williams,

23
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:09,941
the hero who saved
Elk Grove from evil.

24
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:13,637
For 30 long years, I've used
this saw on monsters and demons.

25
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,041
But those battles are won,
so now I use it to--

26
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,575
Slash prices!

27
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,886
At Ashy Slashy's Hardware
Store Emporium,

28
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,046
we got you covered!

29
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,089
You want paint?

30
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,231
We shake it till
we break it!

31
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,768
Ladies,
you'll love his nuts!

32
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,243
What's better than
a handful of my nuts?

33
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,137
Ahh!

34
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,309
A long screw.

35
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,207
Whoa!

36
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,509
We got wood.

37
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,751
We got rope.

38
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:51,545
We got rubber!

39
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:52,946
We got it all!

40
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:55,218
Die high prices

41
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:57,888
Goodbye high prices!

42
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:01,523
For that special someone,
we've got everything from

43
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,563
- "D" to "ildo."
- Mmm.

44
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:06,658
Because at Ashy Slashy's,
service is literally...

45
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,901
Not.
... our middle name!

46
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,126
Whoo!

47
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:16,535
Perfection!
And only 22 takes!

48
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:18,338
- Welcome back...
- Yeah.

49
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,669
It's looking good,
Jefe.

50
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:21,884
Marketing 101,
Pablo.

51
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,446
Know your audience.

52
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:26,376
Look at them
lining up out there.

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,220
You're a badass!

54
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,545
You know I've never seen
a town lose its shit

55
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:32,652
over a hardware
store before.

56
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:33,764
Well, it's time
to wake up and smell

57
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:36,315
the lightly scented
wax flowers, Pablo.

58
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:39,693
This isn't just a well-stocked
hardware store/sex-toy emporium.

59
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:42,504
No, this is a shrine
to a local hero.

60
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,567
Those adoring
fans are my peeps!

61
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,780
All right!

62
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:57,136
Hey, hey!

63
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,654
Hello, Elk Grove!
Hey, hey!

64
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:04,618
Are you ready for some
hardware?!

65
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,919
Come on in!

66
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,562
Fishing supplies,
aisle two.

67
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:14,258
We got guns, we got flags,
we got pornography.

68
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,256
That's a little further
in the back.

69
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,831
Men, can't please
your wives?

70
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,533
Better check out
aisle seven.

71
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:21,595
Yeah!

72
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:24,143
Same problem?
No need to push, jeez.

73
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,038
Aisle 3 I think.

74
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,579
Hey, no need to push.
Leave me alone.

75
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:31,683
And last up we have Amy,

76
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:35,479
who I'm told has made
a startling discovery.

77
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,193
I see here, Amy, that
you discovered this item--

78
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,585
In the mud.

79
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,387
In the mud.

80
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,702
Well, I know. I'm sorry...

81
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,574
What I fucking
tell you, huh?

82
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,169
How many times
I got to tell you?

83
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,110
Pretzels are for paying
customers only!

84
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,236
Okay?

85
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,781
Next time I'll use your
head as a fucking cue ball.

86
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:06,548
Who touched the T--
who touched the TV?

87
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:08,578
How many fuckin'--

88
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,729
Hey, hey, it's me.

89
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:29,196
You were right,
evil's coming back.

90
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:32,613
And here you've found a book
written in ancient Sumerian.

91
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:35,909
Curious.

92
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,510
Does "curious"
mean valuable?

93
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,212
This appears
to be some sort of...

94
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,954
descriptive passage.

95
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,020
Conda anu astratta
alaktu...

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,490
You know with most
of these clowns,

97
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,518
I got to play hardball,
but for you?

98
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,533
Hose clamps
are half-off.

99
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,925
These are the best
in the world.

100
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,357
You put them on,
they grip tight.

101
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,832
They don't slip, slide, stretch,
or tear like other things.

102
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,633
... estaro ces reche.

103
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:03,435
Sarr des kanda...

104
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,642
Kanda...

105
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,376
kanda?

106
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,481
What?

107
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,122
Apparently you've found
an ancient text,

108
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:22,459
known as the
Necronomicon-Ex Mortis.

109
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,655
The Book of the Dead.

110
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Is that... good?

111
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:30,731
The book,
is said to hold spells

112
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,672
and incantations that,

113
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,198
if read out loud...

114
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:40,044
... could connect the demons
of the netherworld,

115
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:41,441
with our own--

116
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:55,885
Most important
thing about a hose,

117
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,620
is its width,
and its length.

118
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,455
Mostly the length.

119
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:01,632
Our scheduled broadcast

120
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,299
will resume
in a moment.

121
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:05,297
Hey!

122
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,329
I paid for
two more spots!

123
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,444
Okay, we got two
fish tacos.

124
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,436
Bam!

125
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,467
We got your
hard drive.

126
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,612
That's me. Thank you.
Enjoy.

127
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,376
Oh yeah.
Oh!

128
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:18,681
I don't know...

129
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,050
Excuse me.

130
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:23,922
Oh! Shit--

131
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,154
Who are you?

132
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,875
Well in Rome, they called me
mulier daemonium de igne.

133
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,382
Demon woman of fire.

134
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,653
And in Greece,
they called me

135
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,292
ágria ti mitéra
apó tin kólasi.

136
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,389
Fierce mother from hell.

137
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:08,361
But in these benighted times,
they just call me Ruby.

138
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,662
I'll take that.

139
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,974
No! No! Wait!
It's too important--

140
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,535
This is bullshit.

141
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,181
Whatever happened
to free speech?

142
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,506
Ah, this was my best
giant penis yet.

143
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,181
Yeah.

144
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,880
Thanks for talking me into this.

145
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:29,222
You missed a spot.

146
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,446
Dick.
Less.

147
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,418
Can we just finish
and get out?

148
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,322
I'm in enough
trouble already.

149
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,264
Wait till they see what
I drew on Perkins' car.

150
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,661
Is "man-gina" a word?

151
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,299
Oh, Rachel, please.

152
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,171
I just want to get through
the next four months.

153
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,770
Since when did you become
Miss Bourgeoisie?

154
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:53,513
Oh, it's simple.

155
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,307
I graduate,
I can leave here.

156
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,849
I leave here, I'm not here,
and that's a good thing.

157
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,377
All right, you still haven't
fallen for Elk Grove's

158
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,252
"small town charms?"

159
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,150
Excuse me?

160
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,452
The whole town's excited
because their ex-psycho killer

161
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,794
is opening
a hardware store.

162
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,631
Kill me now.

163
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,226
Could be worse.

164
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,298
How?

165
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,296
We could be like them.

166
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,899
Oh, yeah.
That'll never happen.

167
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,542
Good, because
if you did,

168
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:24,867
I would have
to slit my wrists.

169
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,749
Oh, look.
Cougie's back.

170
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,289
Yeah, well,
fuck off, Cougie!

171
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,427
Okay, we get it.

172
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,069
Costume, mascot,
very funny.

173
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,399
You can leave now!

174
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,313
Hey, asshole!

175
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,138
Go away--

176
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,378
Shit.

177
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:08,581
Shit.

178
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:13,552
Okay, guy, now I'm mad.

179
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,230
Jesus, what is that?

180
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,135
Probably just some
varsity assholes

181
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,107
playing some
bullshit prank!

182
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,336
Ah!

183
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:39,078
Brandy, don't!

184
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,910
What is your problem,
fuckboy?

185
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,206
Help!

186
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,749
Help!
Help please!

187
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,759
And that's
the whole story.

188
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,815
Hey, feller.
Hey. How are you?

189
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,763
Ladies. Come on.

190
00:10:58,859 --> 00:10:59,829
A litlle somethin',
somethin'.

191
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,226
There we go.

192
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,373
Nickel for a tickle, huh?

193
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:06,425
What do you say?

194
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,070
I don't believe this,
it's really him.

195
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:16,336
- Oh, hey. Hey, honey.
- Mom! Mom!

196
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,053
There's this guy at the school,
you've got to come

197
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,175
help us, please!
What?

198
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,980
Hey, Pablo.
Yeah.

199
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:23,052
Ah, I got to talk to you about
something else.

200
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,120
If this is about
a raise--

201
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:27,089
Actually, you don't pay me
at all right now, but--

202
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,058
Son of a bitch!

203
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,586
Hey, whoa!

204
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,431
Lady!
There's a line!

205
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,426
Wha-- ? You don't
even remember me?

206
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,459
Well, the old steel trap
never forgets a rack,

207
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,604
but faces are
a little fuzzy.

208
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,471
Give me a hint.

209
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,571
I said a hint.

210
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,013
I'm your fucking wife!

211
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,006
My what?

212
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:52,512
We need to talk.

213
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,554
Lady, I don't know what
kind of coo-coo juice

214
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:00,323
you've been drinkin',

215
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:01,591
but if you're fishing
for alimony--

216
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,928
One of your goddamn monsters
just attacked our daughter

217
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:05,885
at Kenward County High.

218
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,232
Daughter?! Ha!

219
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,398
You definitely
got the wrong guy!

220
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,126
Demons made you
chop off your hand.

221
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,032
"I'll swallow your soul."

222
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:15,544
Good sex is 30 seconds
followed by a cheeseburger?

223
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,035
Okay, maybe we have met.

224
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,581
But in case you didn't
get the memo,

225
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,445
me and my compadres,
we buried evil big time.

226
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:27,045
Elk Grove is officially
a demon-free zone.

227
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:28,848
Jefe.
Yeah.

228
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,379
I think she's telling
the truth.

229
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:40,228
Dude, I told you to get that
shit lasered off.

230
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,227
Nah, I didn't
do this!

231
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,599
It just happened outside.

232
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,097
I'm scared!

233
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,299
This thing is after
my little girl and--

234
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:49,501
All right all ready!
I'll check it out!

235
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,388
Just like old times,
eh, Pablo?

236
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,687
Except for the wife part,
and no Kelly.

237
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,459
Actually, it's not like
old times at all.

238
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,327
Just drive!
Hey, easy for you sister.

239
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,057
You come waltzing
into my life,

240
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,962
yapping about demons
and daughters,

241
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,973
and I don't know
boo about you.

242
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,635
Candace Barr.
Yeah, and?

243
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:25,074
Branson?

244
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,542
Branson.

245
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,007
Oh...

246
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:37,953
Oh.

247
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,756
Ah! My God!

248
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:45,125
Oh God! She's so good!
Oh.

249
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:58,407
Wait a minute,
Candace Barr.

250
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,506
Oh no, Candy Barr?

251
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,679
Well, this daughter
of ours,

252
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,850
I'll bet she thinks
I'm pretty special, huh?

253
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,119
Dream on.

254
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,787
I told her her old man
was some crack dealer

255
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:12,845
who got shanked in prison.

256
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:13,953
What?!

257
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,364
Well, it was easier
than admitting

258
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:18,386
I'd hooked up with
some psycho saw-boy!

259
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:21,832
Oh, okay, but I call
B.S. on the daughter.

260
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,958
I was using my lucky rubber
all through the odds,

261
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,504
and that sucker
went 50 and 0.

262
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,370
Oh, oh, oh.

263
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:31,941
Just drive!

264
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:34,274
Candalier boncelo....

265
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,193
Kanda.

266
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,445
Abomino.

267
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,797
God, that smell.

268
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:38,796
This monkey farm hasn't
changed in 30 years.

269
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,199
The caller you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

270
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,640
She's not answering.

271
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:43,799
You actually
went to school?

272
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,514
Yeah, these halls have
some sweet memories.

273
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:47,807
Met my first
Linda here.

274
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,251
Hey, give me
a second.

275
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,017
What are you doing?

276
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,394
I'm sorry, I don't
even know you,

277
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,416
but did I make a mistake
coming to Ash for help?

278
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,962
Ever since I hooked up
with El Jefe,

279
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,000
I've seen a lot of weird
shit go down.

280
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,966
He's always
had my back.

281
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,295
Well,
almost always.

282
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,071
There was this one time
I got cut in half.

283
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,299
What?

284
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,774
Yeah, but Ash went back
in time to save me.

285
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,613
It was so cool,
but also really weird,

286
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,379
because when we got back,
nothing seemed to have changed.

287
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:28,279
Maui Wowie.

288
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,651
It's my emergency stash.

289
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,051
I'll just put this bad boy away
for the appropriate time.

290
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,493
Brandy?

291
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,027
Shh, shh!

292
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,208
Whoever's out there,
fuck off!

293
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:33,913
Brandy?

294
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:36,719
Wow.

295
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:39,047
She's not yours,
dumb-ass!

296
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,622
Mom!

297
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:42,761
Honey!
Thank God!

298
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:43,956
Back off, Mama Bear!
Hey!

299
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,287
What are you doing?

300
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,031
The ink on my buddy
went nuclear,

301
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,857
that means evil is just
around the corner.

302
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,603
So your little peach could
be a bowel-sucking hell beast.

303
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,840
Mom, what's the chainsaw
geek doing here?

304
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,336
Oh, honey, uh, I don't know
how to tell you this,

305
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,838
but Ash, he's- he's ah-
he's your--

306
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:03,981
What she's trying
to say is, I'm your pop.

307
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,475
Father dearest.

308
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,550
The old sperm shooter.

309
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,279
What?
But you can call me Dad,

310
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,693
unless you're a Deadite,
then you can go fuck yourself.

311
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,086
So come on now, demon-spawn!

312
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,557
Show Daddy
what you got!

313
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,628
Okay, nobody move.

314
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:31,038
Alleged Daughter,
who else is in the room?

315
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,365
Um, you...

316
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,644
the guy with the hair...

317
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:36,982
... my mom, and--

318
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:47,246
Rachel?

319
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:05,938
Hey, Brandy's friend.

320
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,678
You want to keep it down?

321
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:15,515
Oh! Oh my God! Rachel?
What have you done?

322
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,933
What are you doing?!

323
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,593
Rachel!

324
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,311
Ah!

325
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,292
Ah!

326
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,413
Blow.

327
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,907
No!

328
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:57,081
I love you, Brandy.

329
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,823
Oh!
Ugh!

330
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,065
Candy.

331
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:34,151
Mom!

332
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,640
Why you--

333
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,253
No!

334
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:05,524
Ashy Slashy, soon there'll
be nothing left of you...

335
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:09,988
... we'll destroy your seed
and your whore daughter too.

336
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,430
Sorry jailbait, my dance card
is a little full.

337
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:14,756
I'll have to squeeze you in.

338
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,301
Brandy!

339
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,545
Oh!

340
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,415
Suck on that,
Harpo.

341
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:42,121
Whew.

342
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:49,401
What... what?

343
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,155
I know.

344
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,804
It sucks.

345
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,640
I remember my first
taste of evil.

346
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,339
Oh, Cougie!

347
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,084
They got you too!

348
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:18,223
Ash!

349
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,713
Ah! Whoa!

350
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,493
Howdy fuckin' ho, boys.

351
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:55,904
Miss me?

352
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:04,243
Uh!

353
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,483
Well, looky
who's back,

354
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,884
and seriously rocking
the leather.

355
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:20,292
Who's the boy toy?

356
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,956
Kelly was right.

357
00:25:22,055 --> 00:25:24,155
You are
the prophesied one.

358
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,757
This is Dalton.

359
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,588
He's with
the Knights of Sumeria.

360
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,763
The who with the huh?

361
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,531
It's an honor
to meet you.

362
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,430
I've been waiting for the chance
to battle this ancient evil

363
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,732
my entire life.

364
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:37,343
Yeah, he's
kind of a fan.

365
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:38,537
Who's the kid?

366
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,410
Oh, believe it or not,
that's my daughter.

367
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,449
Sandy.

368
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:47,105
Ah, Mandy.

369
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,313
Brandy.

370
00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:50,852
And fuck you.

371
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:52,791
We're still getting
to know each other.

372
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,785
Okay, team,
it looks like evil's back,

373
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,218
and Elk Grove
is ground zero.

374
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,734
Kelly, Pablo.

375
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,585
Other guy,
you up for this?

376
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,004
One for all,
and all for one.

377
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:04,796
Uh, cute, but no.

378
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,927
Pablo?

379
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,432
Say it like
you mean it.

380
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:09,904
Ghost Beaters are back!

381
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:12,413
Fucking A,
right we are!

382
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:13,765
And evil...

383
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:16,143
oh, we're coming
for you.

384
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,408
I think now is the appropriate
time Pablo.

385
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:31,924
Sandy?
