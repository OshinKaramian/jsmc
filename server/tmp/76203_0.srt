I thought on it long and hard.

1089
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:42,198
It is melancholia.

1090
01:19:42,657 --> 01:19:44,237
Nothing more.

1091
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,250
How can you fall into such despair?

1092
01:19:48,413 --> 01:19:51,373
How can you not know?

1093
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:57,460
I ain't got no comfort in this life.

1094
01:19:59,716 --> 01:20:03,716
If I can't buy mercy from you...

1095
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:06,104
I'll beg it.

1096
01:20:06,222 --> 01:20:07,722
There are others.

1097
01:20:08,975 --> 01:20:10,305
-Beg them.
-I'm begging you.

1098
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:11,595
Why?

1099
01:20:12,312 --> 01:20:16,192
Why would you consign me to
damnation with such an ungodly request?

1100
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:18,356
There is God here!

1101
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:22,534
God is merciful...

1102

You're Judge Turner's for the season.

01:22:58,061 --> 01:22:59,401
Get out.

1129
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:53,236
Get off the porch.
You ain't supposed to be on the porch.

1130

No, sir, I have not.

Working a field
and picking cotton like a lowly hand.

I'm of a damn sight better station.

1201

1203
01:29:52,726 --> 01:29:54,306
Not "sir."

arrive at such a place, if I may ask?

Ask, it's just conversation.

1208
01:30:08,116 --> 01:30:11,076
I became
a little too dependent on the whiskey...

1209

I'm just a sorry drunkard...

1212
01:30:21,004 --> 01:30:23,054
As reliable employment as overseeing is,

1213
01:30:23,214 --> 01:30:25,264
it is no easy chore on the spirit.

1214
01:30:26,134 --> 01:30:28,974
I say, no man of conscious...

1215
01:30:29,095 --> 01:30:31,465
can take the lash
to another human day in and day out...

1216
01:30:31,598 --> 01:30:34,138
without shredding at his own self.

1217
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:37,273
Takes him to a place...

1218
01:30:37,395 --> 01:30:42,025
where he either makes
excuses within his mind to be unaffected...

1219
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,700
or he finds some way
to trample his guilty sensations.

1220
01:30:46,613 --> 01:30:48,283
So, I trampled.

1221
01:30:48,406 --> 01:30:50,366
With frequency.

1222
01:30:51,993 --> 01:30:55,083
I gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity.

1223
01:30:58,249 --> 01:31:02,709
But such profitable outcomes are
reserved for plantation masters.

1224

to earn a decent wage and get myself home.

1235
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:13,239
It's a simple enough request.

1236
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:16,406
I only ask that you deposit a letter

1237
01:32:16,494 --> 01:32:18,294
at the post office in Marksville...

1238
01:32:18,413 --> 01:32:21,963
and that you keep the action
an inviolable secret forever.

I'll do it.

1241
01:32:36,056 --> 01:32:38,426
And I'll accept whatever payment's offered.

1242
01:32:41,227 --> 01:32:43,687
To assist you, I put my own self at risk.

1243
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:46,401
I will do so...

1244
01:32:46,524 --> 01:32:49,654
but fair compensation is all I ask.

1245
01:32:59,245 --> 01:33:01,245
Draw up your letter.

waked him up in the middle of the night...

1261
01:35:10,377 --> 01:35:13,127
and wanted him to carry a letter...

1262
01:35:14,339 --> 01:35:16,089

1263
01:35:21,221 --> 01:35:23,521

There's no truth to it.

1376

you have the right to hold a nigger.

1385

It is a fact, a plain and simple fact...

1386
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:53,400
that what is true and right
is true and right for all.

what is the difference?

1390
01:44:04,202 --> 01:44:05,702

what the difference is

-No!
-Master Epps.

1443

Now, you speak?

Now that you want
to add to her lies, you find your tongue!

1445
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:12,680
I went to Master
Shaw's plantation.

1446
01:47:12,724 --> 01:47:14,354
Ah! You admit it.

1447
01:47:14,601 --> 01:47:16,021
Yes, freely.

1448
01:47:16,144 --> 01:47:18,024
And you know why?

1449
01:47:18,146 --> 01:47:20,606
I got this from Mistress Shaw.

1450
01:47:21,232 --> 01:47:25,202
Mistress Epps
won't even grant me no soap to clean with.

1451

I make myself gag!

1455
01:47:40,210 --> 01:47:42,210
And for that, I will be clean.

I'll stick to that.

02:03:22,402 --> 02:03:24,242
I'm gonna be seeing you real soon.

1621
02:03:24,404 --> 02:03:26,414
Solomon, we need to make haste.

1622
02:03:28,158 --> 02:03:29,158
No.

1623
02:03:29,617 --> 02:03:31,077
Solomon.

for my appearance.

1626
02:05:16,725 --> 02:05:18,595
But I have had...

1627
02:05:19,602 --> 02:05:21,562
a difficult time...

1628
02:05:22,564 --> 02:05:25,364
these past several years.

Who is this?

1632
02:06:12,739 --> 02:06:14,699
He's my husband.

1633
02:06:16,284 --> 02:06:17,414
Husband.

1634
02:06:18,286 --> 02:06:21,576
It is very good to meet you, sir.

1635
02:06:23,375 --> 02:06:25,535

1636
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:27,170
Yes, sir.

1637
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:32,380

02:06:54,447 --> 02:06:55,657
(SOBBING) Anne...

1641
02:06:58,159 --> 02:06:59,989
forgive me.

1642
02:07:03,456 --> 02:07:07,036
There is nothing to forgive.

1643
02:11:38,273 --> 02:11:41,613
WOMAN: (SINGING)<i>
